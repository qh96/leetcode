Given a string S&nbsp;and a character C, return an array of integers representing the shortest distance from the character C in the string.

Example 1:


Input: S = &quot;loveleetcode&quot;, C = &#39;e&#39;
Output: [3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0]


&nbsp;

Note:


	S string length is&nbsp;in&nbsp;[1, 10000].
	C&nbsp;is a single character, and guaranteed to be in string S.
	All letters in S and C are lowercase.
